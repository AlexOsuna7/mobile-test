# Superformula Mobile Developer Coding Test


This repository contains two main components:

1. **API Backend (Ktor)**  
   A Kotlin-based REST API server that generates and validates seeds for QR codes.

   See details and instructions here: [ktor-api/README.md](ktor-api/README.md)

2. **Android App**  
   The Android client application that consumes the API, generates QR codes, and scans them.

   See details and instructions here: [app/README.md](app/README.md)
