# Android QR Seed App

This Android application interacts with the Ktor backend API to generate, display, and validate QR code seeds.

## Features

- Fetches a seed from the backend `/seed` endpoint and generates a QR code.
- Scans QR codes to extract seed data.
- Validates scanned seeds against the backend `/validate` endpoint.
- Floating action button with speed dial menu for easy navigation between screens.
- Offline support with simple caching for the last fetched seed.
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns and dependency injection using Dagger2.
- Navigation using Jetpack Navigation Component.
- JSON serialization with Kotlinx Serialization.
- Unit tests for key components.

## Requirements

- Android Studio Flamingo or newer
- Android SDK 33+
- Kotlin 1.9+
- Internet connection for API calls

## Getting Started

### Build & Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio. 
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or device with camera access.

## Screens
### Home Screen:
Displays the last generated seed QR code or a prompt to generate one.

### Generate Seed:
Fetches a new seed from the API, caches it, and displays it as a QR code.

### Scan Seed:
Opens the camera to scan a QR code and validates the seed against the API.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the App**  
   Open the app on your device or emulator.

2. **Generate a QR Seed**
    - Tap the floating action button (FAB).
    - Select ‚ÄúGenerate QR‚Äù.
    - The app will fetch a new seed from the backend and show it as a QR code.

3. **Scan a QR Code**
    - Tap the FAB again.
    - Select ‚ÄúScan QR‚Äù.
    - Allow camera access and scan any QR code generated by the app.

4. **Validation**
    - The scanned seed will be sent to the backend `/validate` endpoint.
    - You'll receive a message indicating whether the seed is valid, expired, or unknown.

### üîÑ Optional

- If offline, the last fetched QR will be cached and shown.
- Seeds expire after 10 minutes; trying to validate after that will show a message.

## Architecture & Libraries
Architecture: MVVM with Clean Architecture principles.

Dependency Injection: Dagger2

Navigation: Jetpack Navigation Component

Networking: Ktor HTTP client or Retrofit (depending on implementation)

Serialization: Kotlinx Serialization

QR Code: ZXing or any other QR library

Testing: JUnit, MockK

## Configuration
    API base URL configured in BuildConfig or a config file.
    Cache strategy uses local storage to save the last seed and its expiration.

## Logging & Debugging
Logs network calls and validation results.
